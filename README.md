### Approach

In creating this project, my primary goal was to balance both functionality and aesthetics. I wanted to ensure that the website was not only visually appealing but also highly usable and responsive. To achieve this, I adopted a design-first approach, starting with wireframes and prototypes using Figma. This allowed me to iterate on the design quickly and gather feedback before diving into the actual development.

Once the design was solidified, I implemented the frontend using a combination of HTML, CSS (with Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling), and JavaScript. Tailwind CSS was particularly helpful in maintaining a consistent design system across the website, enabling rapid styling without writing a lot of custom CSS. For smooth scrolling and a more polished user experience, I integrated libraries like Smooth Scroll.

### Challenges

One of the main challenges I faced was ensuring that the website looked good while also being functional across various devices and screen sizes. Balancing the aesthetic elements with usability required careful consideration and multiple iterations.

**Utility and Aesthetics**: I aimed to create a visually appealing site that also performed well. This meant making tough decisions about which features to prioritize and which design elements to refine. I often found myself tweaking the layout and styles to achieve the perfect balance.

**Responsive Design**: Ensuring the site was responsive and looked great on all devices was another challenge. I tackled this by leveraging Tailwind CSS's responsive utility classes, testing the site extensively on different screen sizes, and making adjustments as necessary.

**Form Validation**: Implementing basic form validation was crucial to ensure a smooth user experience. I wrote custom JavaScript to handle form submissions and provide immediate feedback to users, which required thorough testing to get right.

Overall, this project was a rewarding experience that taught me a lot about the nuances of web design and development. By focusing on both utility and aesthetics, I was able to create a website that not only meets functional requirements but also provides an engaging and visually pleasing experience for users.
